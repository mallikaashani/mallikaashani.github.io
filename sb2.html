      <h1>ScheduleBuilder: Managing Our Most Important Resource</h1>
      <h2>September 8, 2017</h2>

      <div>

	After the initial survey and considerations around reverse engineering your time, I started to draw out a prototype. I went on to create a neater version in Figma that I could use in the user interviews I was planning. There were a lot of difficult questions to consider when initially creating a low fidelity prototype.
</p>

<p>As I started to draw out some ideas, I decided to actually sit down with my brother to plan out his week and create a schedule for the coming seven days. I started out with the 168 hours in a week and started to subtract away the hours spent on doing essential things such as sleeping, eating, and personal grooming. We made assumptions around the average number of hours spent doing those activities and subtracted away the weekly total from 168. This left us with 84 hours. From there we subtracted away time spent on mandatory items such as commute time, class time, and studying. Given my brother was taking one summer class at the time, this left us with 66 hours. When we made this calculation, my brother was quite surprised with the amount of free time he had to fill with whatever he wanted to do. It was enough time to do a full time job even. Next came the fun part of filling out those 66 hours- hanging out with friends, exercise, an online course to take for fun, or even just watch TV. In this manner we filled up all the hours of the week except 10- which we left for unexpected things such as getting sick.
</p>

<p>Based on this framework we scheduled every day depending on his existing time commitments and his personal preferences. For example, he wanted to work out in the mornings and wanted something fun to do in the afternoons. In this manner, he created a unique schedule for every day and set up reminders for everything as needed on his phone. The process was tedious, but it seemed to pay off. He was excited about using his time in a way where he knows he’s getting enough time to relax and enjoy the summer- but also to do enriching activities like online courses or writing for fun.
</p>

<p>The prototype I drew up took a user through a more automated, streamlined version of the process. In this way, users could account for existing time commitments while also making sure that their time reflected their priorities. Here is one of the initial sketches:
</p>

<p>But I knew this would have it’s challenges. First, we conducted a competitive analysis of sorts by researching productivity apps in Apple’s App Store. A lot of apps functioned as some sort of to do list- enabling users to enter their tasks, possibly prioritize them, “check them off” and perhaps get reminders. On the other hand, there were apps that functioned more like calendars where users could input events, add details (such as location), and set up reminders. In a sense, the ScheduleBuilder I was thinking of would attempt to account for both tasks and events. This would be challenging from a design perspective. Combining the two would potentially make it difficult for users to develop an appropriate heuristic around the function of ScheduleBuilder- therefore impacting their interaction with and expectations of the app.</p>

<p>As excited about the solution as I was, I considered various problems. One such issue is the amount of information the user has to input. For instance, maybe people don’t calculate their average time spent eating in a day. Perhaps, having to input a lot of information about your time essentially would only continue the initial problem of scheduling being tedious.</p>

<p>Another challenge I thought about from the very beginning was the difficulty of getting users to input a bunch of information about themselves. In general, this is something I hate doing as a user- whether that’s filling out billing information on an eCommerce site or writing my personal information on a form. The process of entering data around your commitments would have to be automated as much as possible- for example, by syncing their Google Calendar. It would also have to be as simple and efficient as possible. This would involve providing them with relevant information (ex. “Number of hours left in the week”) and also being clear about what is being asked and why. Lastly, as with almost all such processes, any potential errors should be easy to fix. For example, the user should be able to edit the information they inputted and should get any relevant error messages at appropriate times (ex. If they overbook themselves).
</p>

<p>The last big challenge on my mind was more general. As I looked at existing apps, I found that there wasn’t really something like ScheduleBuilder (at least the idea in my head) out there. If there is something like it out there, it is not widely used. This brought up questions of why. Perhaps, while trying to design a solution for time management, I’d realize that such an application is not feasible, too complicated, or not practical for a large enough number of users. In any case, I wanted to create a low fidelity prototype to experiment with. Here is how I started out:
</p>

<div><img src="img/blog/b3-2.jpg"></div>
<div><img src="img/blog/b3-3.jpg"></div>
<div><img src="img/blog/b3-4.jpg"></div>
<div><img src="img/blog/b3-5.jpg"></div>

<p>From there, I could show users, get their opinions, and adjust accordingly. I wanted to know all about the user’s current situation in terms of what they did and how they managed their time, walk them through the prototype to see how they would use such an app, and then ask them about their general impression on its usefulness as well as any changes they’d make to the app. I found the results to be really interesting- while some things were expected for me, other insights were surprising and exciting to learn about. More on that in the next post.
