    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <div class="aboutMe">
      <div><img class="reading--img" src="img/reading2.jpg"></div>
      <p>I’m a recent Cal alum looking for fulltime opportunities and here’s a little bit about me:</p>

      <p>Growing up, I went through phases of intense intellectual interest in a wide variety of topics- from ancient history to neuroscience to political science to philosophy to business. I also developed hobbies like public speaking, playing the harmonium, and writing. Extracurriculars in high school like Academic Decathlon and Mock Trial further solidified my excitement about various topics while also teaching me important lessons around team building and leadership. When I went to Cal for undergrad, I wasn’t sure exactly what to study but found Cognitive Science to be the ideal major for me. With my major allowing me to explore how the human mind functions through different perspectives, I focused on computer science to develop analytical skills and become a great problem solver. Simultaneously, inspired by the entrepreneurial climate of the Bay Area, I took project based classes around themes of entrepreneurship in technology. In these classes, I gained hands on experience and learned from the insights of rising entrepreneurs, experienced businessmen, and even influential VCs like Vinod Khosla. The UC Berkeley experience has been enriching not only in terms of building knowledge, but also in terms of learning how to learn, being a critical thinker, and perhaps most importantly in developing a sense of possibilism about the power of technology to improve our world. </p>

      <p>Aside from my coursework and extracurricular activities, I explored career paths and gained some hands on experience through my internships. I was lucky get a range of experience both in terms of the type of organizations I got to work at as well as the type of projects I got to do. My key takeaway so far is the importance of being a job crafter. In demonstrating this, a story of the stone cutter and the cathedral builder comes to mind. I’ve learned to keep the overall vision in mind as you work on specific details of a project. With that kind of thinking, it’s easier to be creative in the solutions you build and also excited about what you’re producing. You’re also more likely to be proactive and curious about learning more. Instead of zoning out on long conference calls, you’re more likely to ask critical questions and connect the dots to drive more impactful work. Instead of simply sticking to your job description, you’re more likely to talk to people across the organization and contribute to their efforts. In all the internships I’ve done, I’ve aspired to be that person and I’ve found valuable mentors and picked up relevant skills in the process.</p>

      <div><img class="table--img" src="img/teatable.jpg"></div>

      <p>As I look forward to future aspirations, I’m excited about roles and organizations where I can use a combination of design thinking, business knowledge, and technical tools to drive strategy, inform decisions with data, and help build impactful products. I hope to be trained, supported, and mentored- but more importantly challenged to produce better solutions, think deeper, and work smarter.</p>
