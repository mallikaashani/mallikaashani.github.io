      <h1>Why Food Matters</h1>

      <div>
      	<p>
      		How many human activities involve the use of all five of our senses? I could think of only two such activities- one having to do with our survival as a species and the other having to do with our reproduction as a species. I am, however, very interested in the former- cooking and eating.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      		Through food, humans find immense pleasure because of the variety of different sensory experiences that become available through it. From the crispness of a sweet apple to the chewiness of sourdough bread, there are many textures in food. There are variations in taste- the sweetness of a mango is very different from the sweetness of a banana. Not only that, there is the sourness of tamarind and the briny saltiness of a pickle. We also eat with our eyes- for instance, the redness of a strawberry indicates the freshness of the fruit and is seen as delicious. Food is comforting with its smells- for instance, the comforting smell of chocolate chip cookies in the oven. We cook with our ears, listening for the bubbling of boiling broth or the sizzling of onions sautéing in EVOO. Thus, food gives us an experience integrating all five of our senses.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      		This is significant, not only because of the plethora of food related experiences to be had, but because of how the human brain processes it. Food gives us pleasure with the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. We bond with food due to the release of oxytocin (a hormone that promotes social motivation, social recognition, trust, and pair-bonding)- perhaps that's why first dates are food related. In addition, the integration of all our senses enhances the storage of memories in our hippocampus. Given these effects, food is an important part of the human experience- and cooking is perhaps the most significant body of human knowledge.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      		Cooking is the art and science of gathering ingredients in the natural world- whether that's a grain of rice or a fruit from a tree or a vegetable in a garden, and pairing various ingredients, and applying various techniques to it- whether that's baking, frying, or roasting. It creates a product that is both a pleasurable experience to our five senses but also nutritious and nurturing to our bodies.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      		Unfortunately, cooking is becoming a lost art, because people have less time, money, and energy to dedicate to it. In 1965, the average American family would spend 60 minutes preparing dinner. Today, it has decreased to 27 minutes. This is related to how food costs have changed in the last 30 years. While the price of processed food has decreased 7%, the price of produce has gone up 40%. Now more than ever, we are outsourcing cooking to restaurants and corporations and losing our connection to our food.

      	</p>

      	<p>
      		As a college student, I am guilty of buying the cheapest and fastest calories- whether that's with greasy take-out food or by making myself instant noodles. However, this year, I am on a mission to change my relationship with food. I've been buying more produce, cooking, and sharing food with friends. One main motivation for this blog is to document this experience. I’d also like to explore food more- whether that’s introducing a new ingredient to my recipes or tasting an unfamiliar cuisine. I hope to improve my lifestyle, share some tips and lessons that I’ve picked up along the way, and create a stronger connection to food.
